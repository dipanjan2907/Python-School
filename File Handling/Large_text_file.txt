Python is a versatile programming language.
It is widely used in web development, data science, and automation.
The CBSE Class 12 Computer Science syllabus includes file handling.
File handling allows reading, writing, and modifying files efficiently.
Python provides built-in functions for text, binary, and CSV file operations.
Text files store data in human-readable format.
Binary files store data in a compressed format, making them faster.
CSV files are useful for storing structured data in tabular format.
The read() function reads the entire file at once.
The readline() function reads one line at a time.
The readlines() function returns a list of all lines in a file.
The write() function is used to write data into a file.
The append() mode allows adding new content without overwriting.
The r+ mode allows both reading and writing.
The seek() function moves the file pointer to a specific position.
The tell() function returns the current position of the file pointer.
File handling is crucial for working with real-world data.
Many applications use file handling for data storage.
Log files record system activities and errors.
Configuration files store software settings in a readable format.
Python's built-in modules make file handling easy.
The pickle module is used for object serialization in binary files.
Pickling converts Python objects into a byte stream.
Unpickling reconstructs the original object from the byte stream.
The csv module allows reading and writing CSV files.
The DictWriter() class writes dictionaries into CSV files.
The DictReader() class reads CSV files and returns dictionaries.
CSV files use commas to separate values in a structured format.
Handling large files efficiently requires memory management.
Buffered file reading improves performance when working with big files.
The with statement ensures proper file closing automatically.
Exception handling prevents errors while working with files.
Permissions control access to reading and writing files.
Cloud storage also uses file handling for data storage.
Operating systems use file handling for logs, caches, and settings.
Python scripts can automate file reading and writing tasks.
Data analytics often requires handling large CSV files.
Machine learning models use text and binary data for training.
Cybersecurity logs are stored in files for analysis.
File encryption ensures data security when storing sensitive information.
The os module provides functions to manage files and directories.
The shutil module allows file and directory operations like copying and moving.
Compression formats like ZIP and GZIP reduce file size.
Efficient file handling improves performance in data processing applications.
Regular expressions help in text file parsing and pattern matching.
Automation scripts use file handling for log analysis and reporting.
File permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files.
Metadata in files provides additional details like creation date and size.
File handling skills are essential for software development and data science.

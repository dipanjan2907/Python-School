In a world filled with wonder,
we wander through paths unknown.
The stars above guide us silently,
casting light on endless possibilities.

Some dreams take only five words.
Others are boundless, without end.
Each day brings new beginnings,
with hope woven into each sunrise.

Believe in the beauty of change,
trust the process, even the unknown.
Courage sometimes means moving forward,
even when fear tugs at our hearts.

Listen closely to your soul’s whisper.
Love finds its way, always.
